	"Description"	"Dash is a sample mode to demonstrate the use of the new Mutation scripting tools.

The Survivors must work together in a race against the clock, running through a series of checkpoints until they reach the end of the course. Only one checkpoint is active (glowing) at a time, and once the required number of survivors have touched it then the next checkpoint will activate."
